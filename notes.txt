TODO
	- upgrade turrets like a tower defense game?
	- max AI turret traverse speed
	- turrets only fire when they're in approx angle range
	- TURRET GUNS cannot escape gravity hahaha. Maybe make a separate gravity (or mass) field for turret ammo so only SHIP guns are affected massively.
	- possibility of a TURRETED aimable gun that doesn't fire as good as others but lets you aim while flying around instead of just shooting forward
	- add turrets to carriers, planets, etc
	- DOCK WITH CARRIERS to transfer fuel, re-arm, etc. BETTER NOT CRASH INTO IT THOUGH.
	- can you hit yourself with your own bullets? that could be funny. [need cooldown to leave inital area though]
	- if you take over a planet, do different color dudes start fighting each other like Pikmin?
	- what if dudes build their town on a planet kind of like Populous
	- do we want much larger planets so you can be on one side vs another side of a planet and have rival bases? 
	- we could have actual population (like Populous) running around on the planet, and killable, as a growing resource that gets loaded into colony ships
	+ capture planet on land. indicate captured planet team/player color
	+ rate limit guns
	+ shields. 
		- flash shields when hit
		- pop shields went empty
	- ship hardpoints (that can get hit, like colony storage tanks)
	+ how can we shoot structures if the bullets hit the planet??? 
	- defensive satellites
	- resource sending ships vs people ships
		- the worlds craziest version of OpenTTD in space
	
	- different kinds of RESOURCE planets. water planet. ore planet. etc.
	
	- biome things like stellar formations / mist / etc that have effects in the game. Can't shoot in certain areas (probably not a good idea
	for campers), or if you shoot you have to keep moving because fires start and spread. Nebulas and stuff.
	
	
	- consider moving collision code that's duplicated into object or unit
		- also some other duplicates in places
	+ asteroids don't APPEAR to be splitting into extra pieces, just shrinking
	= NEAT but unsure: BULLETS are (heavily) affected by gravity and arc around planets
	- We could make "more damage to ship = more thrust random velocity variation" as a visual indicator
	- add "interstellar dust" just random particles hitting objects to add "feel" and interaction (no damage, just particle fx)
	- game mechanics: Spawn on nearest available spawn (carrier, planet, etc)

	- asteroid fields like asteroid
	+ add landing 
		+ on planets
		- on carriers/starports
	+ add collision with objects
	+ add bullets/shooting

	- its a little cludgy that we have viewportsmod.viewport viewports. the file name that is. it was cleaner looking with viewport_t for the type.
	+ add std.chrono timing
	- geometric space ships (and drawing routines) that are easily rotable (and scalable for zoom)
	- OH GOSH, none of the draw routines are built for zoom. OH NO.
		- might only need to simply drawing certain things with a zoom factor / scale. But what about all the other stuff like text, helpers, etc.

	- engine smoke/jet flume
	- damage smoking pieces coming off ala war thunder plane debris particles
	
	- PROPERLY TEST wrapRad()
	- instrinsicGraph does NOT handle negative values correctly (do we choose scale based on the width between min and max?)


 - require skill based feats for game mechanics:
 
	- landing gently on planet for X (capture, for example)
	- landing gently on orbiting carrier (gives you researched powerup)
	- getting yourself into an orbit around a planet at correct altitude (new. research/bioscan planet for resources?)
	- land on cruiser/carrier to dock and exchange resources

rewards players for learning skills to naturally "unlock" aspects of the game.

coop mode against fleets, carriers, etc? unlocks, research, progression system for more gameplay time.
	- unlock better ships
	- unlock carriers
	- fly carriers



game changing mechanic:
	- escort, or "pull" a space trailer to colonize a new planet. (wait... but normally you just mark a new place and carriers come.)
		 - you can detach trailers (ala drop bags) to be more nimble during your fight however the trailer could get hit then
		 
		 
	- assemble new space stations (or something) from space by dragging or pushing pieces together

helpful git:
	git commit -am "message"   runs git add with TRACKED files and message. shorthand.
		-> it WILL NOT add new files. run git add .
 	
 	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add
		note there is a difference between git 1.x and git 2.x for git add . and git add -A
		"With Git 2.0, git add -A is default: git add . equals git add -A .. "

	git add -A is short for git add -all? that's a little less typing.
	
	
	
	git diff variations
