TODO
	- We could make "more damage to ship = more thrust random velocity variation" as a visual indicator
	- add "interstellar dust" just random particles hitting objects to add "feel" and interaction (no damage, just particle fx)

	- asteroid fields like asteroid
	- add landing 
		- on planets
		- on carriers/starports
	- add collision with objects
	- add bullets/shooting

	- its a little cludgy that we have viewportsmod.viewport viewports. the file name that is. it was cleaner looking with viewport_t for the type.
	+ add std.chrono timing
	- geometric space ships (and drawing routines) that are easily rotable (and scalable for zoom)
	- OH GOSH, none of the draw routines are built for zoom. OH NO.
		- might only need to simply drawing certain things with a zoom factor / scale. But what about all the other stuff like text, helpers, etc.

	- engine smoke
	- damage smoking pieces coming off ala war thunder plane debris particles
	
	- PROPERLY TEST wrapRad()
	- instrinsicGraph does NOT handle negative values correctly (do we choose scale based on the width between min and max?)


 - require skill based feats for game mechanics:
 
	- landing gently on planet for X (capture, for example)
	- landing gently on orbiting carrier (gives you researched powerup)
	- getting yourself into an orbit around a planet at correct altitude (new. research/bioscan planet for resources?)

rewards players for learning skills to naturally "unlock" aspects of the game.

coop mode against fleets, carriers, etc? unlocks, research, progression system for more gameplay time.
	- unlock better ships
	- unlock carriers
	- fly carriers



game changing mechanic:
	- escort, or "pull" a space trailer to colonize a new planet. (wait... but normally you just mark a new place and carriers come.)
		 - you can detach trailers (ala drop bags) to be more nimble during your fight however the trailer could get hit then
		 
		 
	- assemble new space stations (or something) from space by dragging or pushing pieces together

helpful git:
	git commit -am "message"   runs git add with TRACKED files and message. shorthand.
		-> it WILL NOT add new files. run git add .

		note there is a difference between git 1.x and git 2.x for git add . and git add -A
		"With Git 2.0, git add -A is default: git add . equals git add -A .. "

	git add -A is short for git add -all? that's a little less typing.
